# Comments

The application was developed on two different platforms. In particular, the functionality of adding products for sale has been developed in both the web and the Android mobile platform. The choice to develop this functionality on a Mobile platform is due to the best management of any security problems.
The following image summarizes the deployment of the application:

# Instructions for testing the system


The system is distributed at the link below: https://spring-ship-344311.web.app/client

However, you must use all the features that the system offers you need to do the system installation locally. This is due to the fact that the system relies on third-party products such as "Google Login" or "Google maps" which are registered only under the domain of "localhost". To install and test the software, clone the project and run the command:

```
 npm i --legacy-peer-deps
 ```
Then run the command:
```
ionic serve
```
Now open your browser at http://localhost:8100/client

Remember to consent to push notifications to the browser at the operating system level in order to use them on the system.

As for the android system, it is possible to download the .apk file in the repository directly from the phone. Once the application has been installed, it can be run.

# Some other technical details

For the implementation of the email service, a system based on the SMTP protocol, Python and an Email provider (mailersend) has been implemented.
In this way it was possible to obtain a prototype of the Email service for free.
Some features of angular material have been encapsulated within a library so that they can be used in multiple projects, offering specific APIs for their construction. These features had been deployed at https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-material-things-experiments
